Args for all commands are divided with whitespace.

1. First you need to install packages (uvicorn, fastapi, sqlalchemy, pymysql). Install MariaDB or mySQL (MariaDB is better for this app)

2. Then write connection data to config.json, don't use ROOT user to connect! Also correct "local_ip"

3. Use "recreate_db" to create database for this app

4. To start you need to create a group, use
$create_group <group name>

5. Then create some register tokens by
$create_token <id_group> <id_role> <token_string>

ID of first group from the database is usually "1"
Role is role of user, this token is used to register or to join created group, first user is better to be Owner (ID 3)
Use "roles" to get list of roles

6. After you can "start" server, after that your server can do http. If it doesn't work, check config.json

7. If you do not want to write "start" every time just add it to start_commands.txt, all commands from this file are executed before starting

8. Use register tokens to register on your server from mobile client

9. Control this system using these commands:


#comands list for this server app. Please, read it before using
	$help

#full instruction for starting server
	$help full

#starts FastAPI server
	$start

#stops server and closes this app
	$exit
	$stop

#drops if exists old db and creates new (empty)
	$recreate_db

#managing roles for users
	$roles
	$create_role <name> <id_role_based_on>
	$delete_role <id_role>
	$change_permissions <id_role>
		#permissions list:
		- moderate_publications
		- offer_publications
		- edit_roles
		- edit_group
		- forum_allowed
		- comments_allowed
		- moderate_comments
		- create_tokens
		- ban_accounts

#changes password of user
    $recover <ID_Account|RecoveryContact> <New password>

#shows group list
	$groups

#groups managing
	$create_group <group name>
	$delete_group <group name>

#register tokens managing
	$tokens
	$create_token <id_group> <id_role> <token_string>
	$delete_token <token_id>
	$delete_all_tokens
